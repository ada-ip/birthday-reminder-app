# Birthday Reminder App
## About the project
The Birthday Reminder App is a simple web application built with React that shows a list of people whose birthdays are happening today. It reads data from a static file and displays the names of the people whose birthday is today and how old they are.
I have developed this app to practice components creation and states definition with React.
